    "text": "I graduated with honors from the University of Michigan in 2020 majoring in neuroscience. After earning my B.S. degree, I spent the next year abroad working with English teachers in elementary and middle schools to improve English literacy and comprehension. I returned to the US in 2021, where I proceeded to work as a lab manager in the Yin lab at the University of Michigan. After two years, I started a PhD program at Case Western Reserve University. I am currently a second year student working in Dr. Qi’s lab.\nThanks for exploring my website!"

    "text": "arXiv Preprint | Code\nOver the centuries, I have devoted countless hours to deciphering and translating the ancient scripts and dialects of the various peoples of Middle-earth. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."
